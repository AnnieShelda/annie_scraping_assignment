        "description": "\nIn Trader Joe’s Brown Sugar Boba Mochi, we’ve taken the distinctive flavors & textures of Boba and made them eminiently portable and entirely enjoyable, without the need for a straw!\n\n\nOur Taiwanese supplier knows well the ways of Boba, which originated in their country circa the 1980s. You can think of this candy version as a deconstructed bubble beverage, where the center of each piece is precisely that pearl (aka tapioca ball) that usually lives at the bottom of your Boba cup. Each individual, caramelized- brown-sugar flavored pearl is surrounded by a creamy coating, then given a classic Japanese rice-wrapper treatment.\n\n\n\n",

These delicious, diminutive morsels of super crispy Mochi are like an itty-bitty version of our acclaimed Mochi Rice Nuggets [sku 56990], offering the same salty, savory flavor and satisfyingly crunchy texture, just on a tinier scale. Why the smaller stature? Simply put, Mini Mochi Rice Nuggets will have relatively more surface area per handful (or mouthful), meaning even more crunch with every bite. And that’s no small feat!\n\n\n\n",

We reached out to one of our suppliers to develop this treat just for us, and the result is a warm-weather novelty you’ll only find in our stores. It’s a simple formulation: sweet ube ice cream (known for its vanilla-meets-pistachio flavor), enveloped in a rice-flour-based, purple-hued (from fruit and vegetable juice), mochi wrapper. The chewy exterior leads you to the sweet, creamy center. As the kids say, it’s all good. It really is. Each piece is a mere 80 calories, though we’ve not yet figured out how to eat just one.\n",

        "description": "\nAfter the raving success of our Crispy Crunchy Mochi Rice Nuggets, we weren’t sure we’d find another rice snack capable of knocking our customers’ socks off for a third time. Dare we say, we did! Trader Joe’s Sweet & Salty Umami Crunchies Rice Crackers are made with Japonica rice, a short grain, non-glutinous varietal. Unlike our Mochi snacks, made from glutinous rice, the rice grains in these Crackers don’t break down into an entirely smooth paste. This difference contributes to the Cracker’s unique, craggy texture. These affectionately named Crunchies then get tossed in a Sweet & Salty glaze, made from soy sauce and sugar, that delivers some serious Umami in every bite (To those wheat intolerant folks who sighed at the words soy sauce, great news—the soy sauce in this snack is gluten free, made with rice, instead of wheat. Hooray!)\n\n\n\n",

        "description": "\nIt wouldn’t be much of an exaggeration to call tteok bok ki (pronounced tuk-bow-kee) food fit for royalty: the first historical records of this savory and satisfying rice cake dish come from a 19th century Korean cookbook, where it’s cited as an example of court cuisine. Originally served in soy sauce, tteok bok ki took on its modern- day red hue and sweet, peppery flavor profile via one chef ’s introduction of gochujang sauce in the mid-20th century, and has since become a darling of Korean BBQ connoisseurs and street food aficionados the world over. And now, this rich, spicy delicacy of rather royal origins has found a new domain: The freezer aisle at your neighborhood Trader Joe’s. Make way for Trader Joe’s Tteok Bok Ki!\n\n\n\n",
